This is an automated script for quickly generating jpg-format plots from xls/xlsx/csv files.



## Procedure:

i. Put all the files in the folder 'autoplot_input' under '../autoplot/'. <br />

 
ii. Specify file type in line 3 (file_type = 'xls'; ). 'xls' can be changed to 'xlsx' or 'csv'. <br />

iii. Click 'Run' in MATLAB. If anything pops out, just click 'change path'. It will then parse all the files and generate jpg-format plots respectively and save them into the folder'autoplot_output'. <br />


### File requirement:

i. Independent variable (x vals) should be in the first col, while the depedent variable (y vals) should be in the other columns. No headers needed. <br />

## PS 

Feel free to adjust the font, size, linewidth, x or y labels, and other parameters in the script. Very easy!



# Hooray!
